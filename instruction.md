# Step-by-step procedure of Reflection and Ideation using UDV Cards

## Reflection Activity

### Purpose
- To systematically analyze and critique existing urban data visualizations.

### Introduction
- The activity begins with an introduction to the UDV card deck, explaining each type of card and its role in the activity. If there are more than 5 participants, they are divided into small groups. The cards are provided to the participants, either physically or virtually.

### Tasks for Facilitator
- Facilitators document the work by taking in-progress pictures of the working participants and documenting the outcomes (e.g., filming the presentation, or taking pictures of the resulting artifacts).

### Tasks/Rules
- Participants are provided with an existing urban data visualization. Their task is using the cards to critique and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the visualization according to different aspects, such as data quality, visual encoding, or physical context.

### Core Activity
- Participants carry out the critical reflection, using the UDV card deck as a guide. Optionally, participants are encouraged to propose potential improvements or alternatives based on their card analysis.

### Outcomes
- Participants present their critique to the larger group, explaining their thoughts and proposed improvements.

### Discussion
- After each presentation, a discussion ensues, allowing for deeper exploration of each critique and facilitating shared learning.

## Ideation Activity

### Purpose
- This activity involves using the UDV card deck to brainstorm concepts for a new data visualization.

### Introduction
- Similar to the Reflection Activity.

### Tasks for Facilitator
- Similar to the Reflection Activity.

### Tasks/Rules
- Participants are provided with an urban data visualization challenge, for which they develop ideas. Ideally, participants are provided with context information and requirements from domain experts.

### Core Activity
- Participants carry out the ideation, using the UDV card deck as a guide. They are encouraged to consider different aspects of their design choices, and to collaborate and communicate with other stakeholders.

### Outcomes
- Participants present their design idea, explaining their thought process and the rationale behind their choices.

### Discussion
- After each presentation, a discussion ensues, allowing for deeper exploration of each design idea.
