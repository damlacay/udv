# Development of the UDV Card Deck

Here, we briefly describe the iterative, human-centered design process of the UDV card deck. The UDV card deck is a tool designed to guide meaningful discussions and practical design processes in urban data visualization projects.

## Collecting ideas from researchers
It started from a collaborative effort involving urban data visualization researchers, designers, and practitioners through the [CityVis](https://www.cityvis.io/workshops/2023/) platform. This process drew from a series of CityVis workshops held at IEEE VIS and ACM e-Energy conferences from 2018 to 2020. These workshops brought together diverse experiences, challenges, and perspectives. For more on the UDV design space, see [Goodwin et al. 2021](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9438762).

## Refining the concept
The workshops highlighted key elements for integrating human perspectives into urban visualization design, setting the foundation for our card deck. In order to make these more actionable, we developed different types of cards and activities to transform them into practical, hands-on tools.

## Designing the cards
Next, we designed a cohesive set of cards and developed a series of activities. We experimented with various visual layouts and card sizes to ensure ease of handling and intuitive use. Our goal was to make the considerations and questions on each card quick to read and easily understood by a diverse range of stakeholders.

## Testing and evaluating
Early prototypes were tested in digital and physical formats through pilot studies in Potsdam, Mannheim, and Taipei. Although participants found the cards valuable, they initially faced challenges in navigation. Feedback from these sessions led to refinements, resulting in the [current version of the UDV card deck](https://cards.cityvis.io). Try them out yourself!
